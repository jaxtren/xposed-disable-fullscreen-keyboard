Disable Fullscreen Keyboard
===

An open source Xposed module for android, to disable fullscreen keyboard along with the text input field that takes up the whole screen in landscape orientation.

It works with all android keyboards, including SwiftKey, Swype, Google keyboard, AOSP keyboard etc. 

The module doesn't have a GUI. Just enable it in Xposed Installer, and it will do its magic.
